# ESP32 Power Monitor with MQTT and Home Assistant Integration

This project implements a low-power ESP32-based power monitoring system that uses the ULP co-processor for energy-efficient operation. It periodically wakes up from deep sleep, counts LED pulses from a power meter, and transmits data over WiFi using MQTT to Home Assistant.

## Features

- **Low-power operation** using the ULP co-processor on the ESP32.
- **Real-time pulse counting** providing total pulse count and pulse rate
- **Wifi and battery voltage monitoring**
- **WiFi connectivity** for transmitting data via MQTT.
- **Home Assistant integration** for monitoring power and energy usage.

## Overview

1. **Pulse Counter**: The ESP32 ULP co-processor counts LED pulses during deep sleep.
2. **Data Transmission**: After a preset interval, the ESP32 wakes up, connects to WiFi, and sends the pulse count and rate to MQTT topics.
3. **Home Assistant**: Configures MQTT sensors to display energy (kWh) and power (kW) readings.

## Hardware Requirements

- **ESP32 Board**: Use an ESP32-WROOM-32D with CH340 USB-to-serial chip. 
- **Low-dropout (LDO) Regulator**: Ensure 3.3V 1A capability for WiFi stability.
- **Capacitor**: Add a 220ÂµF capacitor to the 3.3V line for handling WiFi peak currents.
- **Voltage Divider**: Implement an LDR-based voltage divider for LED pulse sensing.

### Power Optimization

- Remove onboard voltage regulator and LEDs.
- Minimize power consumption by selecting boards with efficient USB-to-serial chips.

## LDR Voltage Divider Notes ##

- Monitoring the LED with a LDR
- Disable pull up and pull down
- LDR = 100kOhm with LED on, 500kOhm with LED off
- LDR to ground, 220kOhm to 3.3V
- Voltage = 0.7V LED on, 2.5V LED off

## Battery Voltage Divider Notes ##

- I used two equal values resistors for the battery voltage dividers
- I used quite high value resistors (330 kOhm) to minimise passive current draw.
- However there is impedance in the ADC input pin of approx 1 MOhm which needs to be accounted for in the voltage divider calc.
- An alternative would be to use a GPIO to turn on the voltage divider to take readings, then lower value resistors (i.e. 10 kOhm) can be used.

## Software

### Arduino Code

1. **ULP Co-Processor**:
   - Modified from an example by [Neurotech Hub](https://github.com/Neurotech-Hub/ULP_Example-ESP32-S3-Arduino).
   - Adjusted for ESP32 boards (non-S3) and alternate GPIO pins.
   - Added functionality to track total count, and to determine the pulse rate.

2. **WiFi and MQTT**:
   - Uses the [Nick O'Leary MQTT library](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/).
   - Sends data to `home/esp32/data` and `home/esp32/data2` topics.
